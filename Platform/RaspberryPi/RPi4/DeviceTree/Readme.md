Device Tree for Raspberry Pi 3
==============================

This directory contains a copy of the official Device Trees for the
Raspberry Pi 3 as published by the Raspberry Pi Foundation at
https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot.

Especially, the dtbs found in this directory are an exact copy of
the ones updated by the Raspberry Pi Foundation on 2019.06.24 with
commit `64b5649a41b69d09bfe0ed05448d28a66be3edfd`.

As per [the Foundation's Readme](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/64b5649a41b69d09bfe0ed05448d28a66be3edfd/README.md),
because the dtbs are built from Linux kernel sources, the license
that applies to them is the GPLv2.
